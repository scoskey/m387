## Course description

Math 387 is a successor to Math 187/189 and Math 287. We will continue our study of topics in discrete math using a proof-based approach. The material we cover will include methods of counting, graph theory, and counting using generating functions. At the same tmie we will strive to improve on our investigative powers, our proof-writing ability, and our appreciation for mathematical methods and beauty.

### Anticipated learning outcomes

* Explore mathematical definitions and evaluate mathematical statements
* Read and write mathematical proofs at an intermediate level
* Comfort with mathematical discovery in content area
* Write rigorous and readable proofs in content area
* Possess and exhibit knowledge in content area

### Rough plan

* Weeks 1-3: Introductory and review material
* Weeks 4-7: Counting and equivalence relations
* Week 8: Midterm exam
* Weeks 9-11: Graph theory
* Weeks 12-14: Generating functions and distributions
* Weeks 15-16: Review and final exam

### Course format

The course will be delivered through synchronous remote class sessions. The majority of each session will be spent working as a class or in small groups.

## Grading

### In-class participation 10%

You are expected to attend remote class sessions, and to be prepared to work on current material. The textbook uses an guided discovery format, which means most learning happens by solving problems. That means that we will spend most of our time discussing material and solving problems together with classmates and myself.

### Classwork portfolio 10%

The work you do in class will slowly accumulate and become a portfolio. I will periodically request your portfolio to make sure you have at least attempted every problem requested.

### Homework 40%

Each week I will assign selected problems from the previous week to be typed and submitted as homework. Your work will represent significant collaborations with your classmates, but keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

### Assessments 20% x2

Take-home exams will be given during the 8th week and the finals week of the class.

## Disclaimer

This syllabus is subject to change. I may make refinements and updates in the first week of classes. While I don't expect any substantial changes, due to the unpredictable conditions of this semester, please allow for some flexibility. I will give notice before making any changes to the syllabus.
