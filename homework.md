## Week 14

* Reading for Monday: Finish section 5.2
* Group work for Monday: 230-234
* Reading for Wednesday: Secton 5.3
* Group work for Wednesday: 237-240
* Homework due Tuesday 4/27: ...

## Week 13

* Reading for Monday: Section 5.1
* Group work for Monday: 207-208, 211-213
* Reading for Wednesday: Start Section 5.2
* Group work for Wednesday: 222-228
* Homework due Tuesday 4/20:  
  * Problem 213
  * Problem K: Suppose you can take between 0 and 3 apples, between 2 and 5 pairs, and between 4 and 7 bananas. Suppose you want to take 10 fruits in total. How many ways are there to do this? Set up the problem using generating polynomials, you may use a computer to do the algebra.
  * Problem 226
  * Problem L: Recall the power series for $(1-x)^{-1}$ is $\sum x^k$.  
    (a) Since $(1-x)^{-2}$ is $(1-x)^{-1}(1-x)^{-1}$, find its power series by evaluating $(\sum x^k)(\sum x^k)$.  
    (b) Since $(1-x)^{-2}$ is the derivative of $(1-x)^{-1}$, find its power series by evaluating the derivative of $\sum x^k$.

## Week 12

* Reading for Monday: Start The Coloring of Graphs (via blackboard)
* Reading for Wednesday: Finish The Coloring of Graphs
* Group work for Wednesday: CoG exercise 10
* Homework due Tuesday 4/6:  
  * Problem G: What is the chromatic polynomial of the complete graph on $k$ vertices? Explain your answer.
  * Problem H: Use the reduction algorithm to calculate the chromatic polynomial of the pentagon graph (the edges are (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,1)).
  * Problem I: The degree of the chromatic polynomial is equal to the number of vertices of the graph. Use induction and the deletion/contraction recurrence to prove this is always the case.
  * Problem J: The constant term of the chromatic polynomial is always equal to $0$. Explain why this is always the case. [Hint: how many ways are there to color a graph using a palette of $0$ colors? What does this say about $p(0)$?]
* Notebook 2 due Thursday 4/8: Problems 105-110, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122-123, 126, 141-146, 149-156, 158-159, 164-170, 172-178, 191, 193-194, 196-198, 200-202

* Homework due Thursday 4/1:  
  * Problem 194: Describe Kruskal's (or Prim's) algorithm carefully, and briefly explain why it "works"
  * Problem 198
  * Problem E: Draw a connected weighted graph (not a tree) with at least 7 vertices and at least 14 edges. Run Kruskal's algorithm for the graph to find the minimum spanning tree.
  * Problem F: For the same graph as in Problem E, choose a special vertex $v$ and run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the tree of shortest paths from $v$. Compare with the tree from part $E$.

  * Problem C: Write all sixteen possible Prufer codes with $n=4$ (so the codes have length 2) and draw the corresponding trees.
  * Problem D: What is the relationship between the degree of a vertex, and the number of times the vertex occurs in the Prufer code? Give a complete explanation (proof) your answer is correct.
